// setup() function:
// This function is called once when the program starts. Use it to initialize variables,
// pin modes, start using libraries, etc. The setup function will only run once,
// after each powerup or reset of the Arduino board.
void setup()
{
  // code to initialize processes, sensors or communication
}
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// loop() function:
// After setup() has finished, the loop() function runs repeatedly until the board is turned off.
// Use it to actively control the Arduino board. This function forms the main part of your program
// and usually contains the core logic to repeatedly check sensors, perform calculations,
// update actuators, or other continuous tasks.
void loop()
{
  // the code that needs to run continuously with a delay at the end
}
